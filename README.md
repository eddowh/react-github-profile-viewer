# Installing and Running

Install the `bower` and `npm` modules:

Run on a local server with `webpack`:

Alternatively, you can run it using npm's `http-server`, but make sure the server is run from the root directory, not the `public` directory:

    $ npm install http-server         # if it isn't installed yet
    $ http-server . -p 8080             # feel free to modify
